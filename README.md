## Description of Steps Used
For my first_leo_program, I wrote the following code accordingly:
- `leo new my_project_name`: This was to create my project
- `cd my_project_name`: To change directory to current working directory
- Changed the private key in the .env file to the private key in our leo wallet
- `leo run 2u32 3u32 --network testnet`: This was to add the two numbers which gave us 5u32. u32 is the datatype
- `leo deploy --network testnet`: This made it possible for us to see the changes/activities on our leo wallet
